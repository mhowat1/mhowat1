- 👋 Hi, I’m Meghan Howat @mhowat1
- I’m a Master's student studying Data Science for Public Policy at the London School of Economics
- I'm working to bolster my data analysis and visualization skills in Python
- The projects highlighted below take a publicly available dataset related to a policy problem of interest to me and output one-two key insights (after cleaning and formatting) 
- These insights are highlighted in the html documents with visualizations in matplotlab or plotnine/ggplot packages!
- 🌱 Most of the policy problems studied are related to the creation of sustainable food systems
